# **phi**: A Web-App (and Website) Toolkit and Modular Framework
## Do not use this! It is still in rapid development and in a pre-release stage.
## Status: Version 0.16 â€” Currently: missing core app features; in cross-browser and cross-device testing.

The goal of this project is to create a web application toolkit and framework that is completely open with the fewest of dependencies, built with the best in modern technology and incorporates the modular (component) approach to development. This is also a very opinionated stack that focuses on integration, rather than a mash-up of disparate technologies. Make sure you like my tech-stack before diving in ;)
